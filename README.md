 [---> check out the live project](https://annakrolikowska.github.io/food-order-form/)

This application allows users to place **food orders**. The form includes the following inputs: dish name, preparation time, and dish type (pizza, sandwich, or soup). Depending on the selected type, additional inputs are displayed. 

Creating the project took me approximately 12 hours.

## :bulb: Features
- Design the application layout using **Figma**.
- Implement the application using **React** and **TypeScript**.
- Utilize **React Final Form** for efficient form handling.
- Apply **SCSS** for styling the user interface.
- The form contains the following input fields:
  - **Dish name**: Allows users to enter the name of the dish (text input).
  - **Preparation time**: Enables users to specify the time required for dish preparation (formatted as 00:00:00).
  - **Dish type**: Offers a selection of pizza, sandwich, or soup (select input).
- Depending on the selected dish type, additional input fields are dynamically displayed.
- The form data is submitted via a POST request as **JSON** to the endpoint: https://umzzcc503l.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dishes/.
